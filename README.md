My First Angular Project

Here I go.

So, You will love to use the integrated git source control of the Visual Studio Code. 
For that I have just download the git for Windows from the very official site. (https://git-scm.com/)
If you are using the Windows OS you can directly go to https://git-scm.com/download/win . 

Just download it and you are ready to roll the changes to your gihub directly through the Visual Studio Code editor.
