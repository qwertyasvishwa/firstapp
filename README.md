My First Angular Project

Here I go.

So, You will love to use the integrated git source control of the Visual Studio Code. 
For that I have just download the git for Windows from the very official site. (https://git-scm.com/)
If you are using the Windows OS you can directly go to https://git-scm.com/download/win . 

Just download it and you are ready to roll the changes to your gihub directly through the Visual Studio Code editor.

Also, one more things to remember,
Don't forget to run this command in powershell (Run powershell as administrator), to execute all the Angular CLI command through cmd or Visual Code Terminal : Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
